1-sys :
The python sys module provides functions and variables which are used to 
manipulate different parts of the Python Runtime Environment. 
It lets us access system-specific parameters and functions.
------------------------
Note: for this python GUI Application i used the PyQt v6 package . 

2-PyQt : PyQt is a Python binding for Qt, which is a set of C++ libraries 
and development tools providing platform-independent abstractions 
for graphical user interfaces (GUIs). 
Qt also provides tools for networking, threads, regular expressions, SQL databases, SVG, 
OpenGL, XML, and many other powerful features.
------------------------
3-functools & partial :
The functools module, part of Python's standard Library, 
provides useful features that make it easier to work with high order functions 
(a function that returns a function or takes another function as an argument ). 



Python provides a built-in module called functools that includes a function 
called partial that can be used to create partial functions. 
The partial function takes a callable (usually another function) and a series of arguments to be pre-filled in the new partial function. 
This feature is similar to bind in C++
